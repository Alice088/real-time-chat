# real-time-chat
This is my first big project where it will be serious,
I develop real-time-chat, here I did unit tests for the first time,
I used vue 3 with composition Api (I switched from React), worked with vuex,
vue router, my first time with TypeScript, chai, mocha test libraries,
worked with animations and primevue component library, bye bye
